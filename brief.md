Brief

What you are building:  A backend API for tracking engineering issues. Engineers report bugs, assign priorities, and track status similar to a stripped-down GitHub Issues.

Context

Every engineering team tracks work bugs filed, priorities set, statuses updated. DevTrack is a minimal backend for this. You will build the Django project, model the data using OOP, wire up URL routing, and expose endpoints testable in Postman.

Data model

Two entities. Keep it simple.

Reporter

A person who files issues.

    id - unique integer

    name - full name

    email - contact email

    team - e.g. backend, frontend, devops

Issue

A bug report or task filed by a Reporter.

    id - unique integer

    title - short summary

    description - full details

    status - one of: open, in_progress, resolved, closed

    priority - one of: low, medium, high, critical

    reporter_id - ID of the Reporter who filed this

    created_at - optional, use str(datetime.now())

Relationship:  One Reporter can file many Issues. This is a 1:many relationship - store reporter_id inside the Issue, not the other way around.

OOP design

Model both entities as Python classes before writing any Django code.

Part A - BaseEntity, validate(), and to_dict()

Create an abstract base class BaseEntity. Reporter and Issue must both inherit from it.

issues/models.py

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class BaseEntity(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def validate(self):
        pass

    def to_dict(self):
        return {
            key: value
            for key, value in self.__dict__.items()
        }

class Reporter(BaseEntity):
    def __init__(self, id, name, email, team):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.team = team

    def validate(self):
        if not self.name:
            raise ValueError('Name cannot be empty')
        if '@' not in self.email:
            raise ValueError('Invalid email')

# In views.py:
# from issues.models import Reporter, Issue

Write your own Issue class the same way. Validate that title is not empty, and that status and priority are one of the allowed values.

Part B - Priority subclasses using inheritance

Create two subclasses of Issue that override a describe() method. This is the same method overriding pattern from the add_two_numbers example in class.

class Issue(BaseEntity):

    def __init__(self, id, title, description, status, priority, reporter_id):

        # your init here

        pass

    def validate(self):

        # your validation here

        pass

    def describe(self):

        return f"{self.title} [{self.priority}]"


class CriticalIssue(Issue):

    def describe(self):

        return f"[URGENT] {self.title} — needs immediate attention"


class LowPriorityIssue(Issue):

    def describe(self):

        return f"{self.title} — low priority, handle when free"

In your POST /api/issues/ view, instantiate the correct subclass based on priority and include describe() in the response. For medium and high priority, use the base Issue class.

if data['priority'] == 'critical':

issue = CriticalIssue(...)

elif data['priority'] == 'low':

issue = LowPriorityIssue(...)

else:

issue = Issue(...)

issue.validate()

response_data = issue.to_dict()

response_data['message'] = issue.describe()

return JsonResponse(response_data, status=201)

Note:  Both to_dict() from Part A and validate() from Part A are used here. Parts A and B form one connected system.

Django project structure

Set up your project with the following structure:

devtrack/

manage.py

devtrack/

settings.py

urls.py

issues/

models.py      # your OOP classes go here

views.py

urls.py

    Create a Django project called devtrack

    Create an app called issues

    Register the app in INSTALLED_APPS

    Wire up issues/urls.py inside the project's main urls.py

    Store data in two JSON files: issues.json and reporters.json

Endpoints to build

Reporter endpoints

POST  /api/reporters/  —  Create a new reporter

GET  /api/reporters/  —  Get all reporters

GET  /api/reporters/?id=1  —  Get a single reporter by ID

Issue endpoints


POST  /api/issues/  —  Create a new issue

GET  /api/issues/  —  Get all issues

GET  /api/issues/?id=1  —  Get a single issue by ID

GET  /api/issues/?status=open  —  Get all issues filtered by status

Reading query params:  Use request.GET.get('id') or request.GET.get('status') to read values from the URL.

Sample request and expected response

Use this as your reference for what a correct POST /api/issues/ looks like.

Request

POST /api/issues/

{

"id": 1,

"title": "Login button not working on mobile",

"description": "Users on iOS 17 cannot tap the login button",

"status": "open",

"priority": "critical",

"reporter_id": 1

}

Expected response - 201 Created


{

"id": 1,

"title": "Login button not working on mobile",

"description": "Users on iOS 17 cannot tap the login button",

"status": "open",

"priority": "critical",

"reporter_id": 1,

"message": "[URGENT] Login button not working on mobile — needs immediate attention"

}

Expected response - 400 Bad Request (validation failure)


{

"error": "Title cannot be empty"

}

Expected response - 404 Not Found


{

"error": "Issue not found"

}

Finding a record by ID:  Read the JSON file, loop through the list, and match on record['id'] == int(request.GET.get('id')). Return 404 if nothing matches.

def get_issue(request):

issue_id = int(request.GET.get('id'))

with open('issues.json', 'r') as f:

issues = json.load(f)

for issue in issues:

if issue['id'] == issue_id:

return JsonResponse(issue, status=200)

return JsonResponse({'error': 'Issue not found'}, status=404)

Submission guidelines

    Working Django project pushed to a public GitHub repository

    OOP classes in issues/models.py - not mixed into views.py

    All endpoints tested in Postman - screenshots of at least one success and one failure for any endpoint in your README

    README.md with: how to run the project, what each endpoint does, one design decision you made and why
